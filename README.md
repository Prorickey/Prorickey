## 📂 Projects

Here are some of my notable projects and teams:

- [**NCTSA Mobile App**](https://github.com/Prorickey/northcarolinatsa): A mobile app built for the North Carolina Technology Student Association to help improve communication and scheduling at their annual state conference. Over the span of a 3-day conference, the NCTSA App served over 2k users and served over 800k requests. 
- [**RoboKnights - FTC 8569 Robotics**](https://github.com/ftc8569): The RoboKnights is the robotics team that I am currently captain of and lead programming in. In just one year, I was able to learn and explore robotics programming and help take my team to the Chicago Robotics Invitational, an international competition. I plan to lead my team to the Worlds competition this year and kickstart a legacy of success. 
- [**SMathHacks 2025 - ARES-M**](https://github.com/Prorickey/SMathHacks25): At NCSSM's annual SMathHacks hackathon, 3 of my friends and I built a small weather pod that, in theory, would be deployed on Mars to help collect weather data over large distances. This could help us better understand weather conditions before landing on Mars. We won the hackathon and hope to participate again in 2026.
